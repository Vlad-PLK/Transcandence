This sections is more about myself and my personnal journey into programming. 
I am young developper living on the french riviera in france working as freelance developper/entrepreneur. I started learning computer science back in middle school with some of the basics html/css, python, algorithms and more. Then after moving into secondary education i joined 42 Nice campus and that's how i really step in CS. I nailed my "piscine" month with success and started the common core in March 2022. After finishing it in mid 2024 i joined a blockchain startup named etherscore for my first internship. After this one i started my own journey and i decided to become a full freelance developper because i wanted to create my own way of all life and experiencing everything i would like in programming.
