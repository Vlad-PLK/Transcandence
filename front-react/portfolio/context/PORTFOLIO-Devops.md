# 🚀 DevOps & Cloud Portfolio ☁️


Welcome to my DevOps & Cloud Portfolio! 👋

I'm actively working towards becoming a **DevOps Cloud Engineer**. Here, I share my progress through hands-on, real-world projects—covering of course Linux, SysAdmin, Shell and the fundamentals of modern systels. But also more of some automation, CI/CD, containerization, cloud infrastructure, and more. Each project is documented with clarity and professionalism, reflecting my dedication to mastering the DevOps and Cloud ecosystem. (With a pinch of humour and tears by the way)

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm transitioning from a "standard" development path after learning computer science at 42 School to a DevOps and Cloud-focused career. I want to challenge myself, to learn new concepts and to discover a totally new path. With a background in **C/C++** and **web development** 🌐, I've enjoyed traditional coding but am now eager to embrace this new way of building, automating, and architecting systems. I'm fully committed to learning all the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this fields and that's why i made this public repo. It is the summary of my journey—documenting my progress as I learn DevOps, cloud technologies, and modern architecture. Oh and by the way don't forget about my blog that you can find at [My Coding Journey day after day](https://vlad-plk.github.io). The title speaks for itself haha 📚
